## Welcome to the magic-chef!

This idea came to my mind on a friday evening. For some reason I left office late and when I came home it was quite late in all senses. I didn't find a restaurant open in my area, all shops were closed, and weekend was just some hours away.

Now this is a tricky situation. I stay alone, so getting food is a big headache. To be honest I am not a passionate cook, so cooking for myself just adds on the already existing headache. So on that night, I am left with no other option but cook a meal for myself, and I opened the fridge. It was as expected. If someone doesn't go to market for weeks, his fridge looks pretty clean! So was mine.

I managed to find some dry items in the fridge, now I don't remember those life savers. Then another question. What I can make out of these? That was a scary question, because as far as I remember these ingredients were not very commonly used. I switched on my computer and googled for recipes. I got a few of them that use the ingredients that I have, then finally managed to cook a meal.

Next day I was talking to my friends about this incident and it seems I am not the odd man out! The whole bachelor community (and even married people) who stay alone have at least once faced this issue. Then this idea stuck into my mind. Why not having an app that will show us what all we can make if we pass the ingredients.

That triggered a weekend development series, and here we go, with the app released in google play.

In case you want to have a look how it feels, here you go:
